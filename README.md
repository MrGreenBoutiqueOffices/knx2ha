# KNX2HA Parser

This project is a **Next.js application** that converts KNX configuration files into **Home Assistant compatible YAML configuration**. It automatically detects entities (lights, switches, covers, sensors, ‚Ä¶) and annotates them for direct use in Home Assistant.

## Key Features

- üîç **KNX Group Address Parsing**<br>
  Converts KNX addresses and DPTs into Home Assistant entities.
- ‚ö° **Smart Heuristics**<br>
  Automatically guesses the correct entity type (light, switch, cover, sensor, ‚Ä¶).
- üìù **YAML Generator**<br>
  Produces valid Home Assistant configurations (`configuration.yaml` or packages).
- üóÇ **Aggregate View**<br>
  Combines related entities into logical sets (e.g., covers with state and position).
- üé® **Customizable Entities**<br>
  Allows manual adjustments and overrides for entity types and names.
- üåç **Next.js Frontend**<br>
  Web interface for uploading, previewing, and exporting configurations.
 - üîÅ **Export/Import Configuration**<br>
   Save your parsed catalog plus all manual overrides to a JSON file and load it later or share with colleagues.
 - üì¶ **Home Assistant YAML Export**<br>
   Download a single combined YAML file or a ZIP with one YAML per domain plus a root `knx.yaml` that `!include`s them.

## Home Assistant YAML export

After parsing a KNX project, open the Export wizard to generate Home Assistant YAML. Select the entity types you want (switch, light, sensor, cover, scene, ‚Ä¶) and choose a format.

Single file
- One YAML with a `knx:` section containing only the selected types.
- Filename uses your project/prefix, e.g. `My_Project_knx.yaml`.

ZIP per domain
- Root `knx.yaml` with `!include` lines for each selected domain.
- Per-domain files in `knx/`, e.g. `knx/knx_light.yaml`, `knx/knx_switch.yaml`.

Use in Home Assistant
- Copy files into your HA config folder. With ZIP, keep `knx.yaml` next to the `knx/` folder and reference it from `configuration.yaml`; or merge the generated `knx:` section into your existing config.
- Addresses and names are auto-quoted; What you export matches the UI preview, including overrides.

## Export/Import configuration

After you upload and parse a KNX project, you can:

- Export config: downloads a JSON snapshot containing the parsed catalog, your current options (like dropping Reserve), and all entity overrides. Use this to continue later or share your work.
- Import config: load a previously saved JSON to restore the catalog, options, and overrides. The Home Assistant YAML view will update immediately.

You‚Äôll find the buttons near the YAML export buttons in the UI.
